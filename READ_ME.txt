To run this project in terminal get to the CH directory and then run the command 'python main.py'.
This will create a local version of the website hosted on the http://127.0.0.1:5000/ webpage.
The website is also deployed on the website https://jake-buchanan-ch.uc.r.appspot.com/ , which requires nothing to do on the command line.
The basic premise of the app is when you are at either the local or deployed webpage, there will be a text box where you input a North
American country 3-digit code.
The program figures out the route from USA to the inputted country.
This is done by a simple if elif... else sequence because it offers low overhead and a data structure would be overkill.
